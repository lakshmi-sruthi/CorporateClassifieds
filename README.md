# CorporateClassifieds
OverView - An organization has to create an Classifieds App for its employees to allow posting of ads on a particular product that the employees can buy and sell within the employee community.
The employee who posts an offer in Classifieds Application is a seller and an employee who shows interest is a consumer.
Though the real selling doesnâ€™t happen over the app, an engagement between the seller and the consumer is created, by liking/commenting to the offer.

Project involves five microservices interacting with each other for the final web application.

Technology used - .NET

Database - in-memory database (No SQL Database is involved)
